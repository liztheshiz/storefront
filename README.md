## Description

This VERY simple app was made following the Programming with Mosh tutorial [Python Django Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHux0gMZ3Eg) in order to familiarize myself with the basics of Django.

## Dev instructions

First, make sure Django is installed globally or in a virtual environment. To run from virtual environment, first find its address by running:

`pipenv --venv`

Then copy this address and run:

`source [address]'

Once you are running in the correct environment, navigate to the project folder and type the following command to start the dev server with all the correct configuration for this project:

`python manage.py runserver 9000`
